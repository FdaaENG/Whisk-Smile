          <p>
            At <strong>Whisk & Smile</strong>, our journey began in a tiny kitchen filled with the
            sweet aroma of freshly baked cookies and the laughter of family gatherings. What started
            as weekend baking therapy turned into a passionate dream â€” to spread happiness, one
            bite at a time.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe every celebration, big or small, deserves a sweet memory. From whimsical
            birthday cakes to cozy cookie boxes, each treat is crafted with care, love, and a
            sprinkle of joy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether youâ€™re cheering someone up, marking a milestone, or simply treating yourself â€”
            weâ€™re here to make life a little sweeter. ðŸ’›
